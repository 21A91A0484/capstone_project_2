	<p><a href="home page"></a>A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element (s). For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph. Note: In contrast to pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes can be used to style an element based on its state.</p>
	<p><a href="about page"></a>Note: In contrast to pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes can be used to style an element based on its state. You can use only one pseudo-element in a selector. It must appear after the simple selectors in the statement. Note: As a rule, double colons ( ::) should be used instead of a single colon (: ).</p>
